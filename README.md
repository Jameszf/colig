# COLIG: A Digital Logic Simulator

This is a digital logic simualtor inspired by [the one Sebastian Lague created](https://sebastian.itch.io/digital-logic-sim) for his [video series on digital logic and how computers work](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFt_AvWsXl0dPhqVsKt1Ni_46ARyiCGSq&si=T1tWYMgxGF9q_4Tf). I am coding this with typescript, and p5js with npm as my package manager.
